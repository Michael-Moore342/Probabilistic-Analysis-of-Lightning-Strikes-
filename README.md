# Probabilistic-Analysis-of-Lightning-Strikes-
This report analyzes lightning peak current data from Johannesburg to identify the best-fitting probability density function (PDF). Three PDFs are compared using statistical tests to evaluate fit quality. Since most distributions cannot handle negative values, only the absolute current magnitudes are analyzed.
